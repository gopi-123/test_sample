# Wifi Adapter Issue solving in ubuntu and Windows
sample testing github


Problem:
Cannot see own wireless network but can see others around me

Every other device can detect my wifi but not my laptop. 
Seemingly after last Windows update (though I'm not sure) I cannot see my own wireless network on my home laptop. I can see all the networks of my neighbors, but not my own.

I can see it and connect to my wireless network with my Work laptop. My partner can see it and connect to it with her two laptops and her smartphone.

I checked the **wireless network adapter (Realtek RTL8723AE Wireless LAN 802.11n PCI-E NIC)**

** Solve wifi issues **:

Best thing is to:
 1) To me the answer is get a new wireless card or a **USB wireless connector**.  or **USB Wi-Fi Adapter**  oer **Wireless USB adapter**

3) I turned on 802-11d and "lo
4) I turned on 802.11d in the network adapter.
5) I had this same issue and wanted to share my experience with a Lenovo IdeaPad Yoga 13 model 20175 and the Realtek Semiconductor Corp. RTL8723AU 802.11n WLAN Adapter. After trying all of the troubleshooting steps in this thread, I can confirm this issue to be driver related as installing Linux on the same hardware does allow finding and connecting to my home network.
6) I had exactly the same problem.It was solved when I changed the settings of the router. Specifically, I tried different "Wireless Modes" (f.x. 802.11b or 802.11b+g+n and so on) until I found one all my computers could see.Hope it helps.
7)  Easier fix.  Reboot router!
8)  Just resolved it. Just go to your router and at your 2.4 connection set the wi-fi mode to  **Mixed 802.11 b/n/g**
9)  I got thinking about this logically and my system said that the Wifi Adapter was working correctly and there were no updates for the drivers. So I thought to myself what controls this? 
This is the Realtek PCle GbE Family Controller.  I got mine to work by opening **Device Manager > Realtek PCle GbE Family Controller > Properties > Advanced > Power Saving Mode** ..  The Power Saving Mode was showing as Enabled... as soon as I made the value to **Disabled**(i.e., not in power saving mode) my wifi internet connection icon changed and it was online once more... So, it was the **Realtek PCle GbE Family Controller** that was stopping the Ralink 802.11n Wireless Lan Card being seen because of the power saving option in the controller... As such it could not connect to the internet.
10) Hi, I had exactly the same problem. I solved it by going in to my router (login as admin) and changed the wireless mode from 802.11ax to to another one such as **802.11b+g+n**
11) Below you can find out how I solved this issue for my laptop:
          1. Log in to your router - you can do this w**ith the login details shown on your router (username and password).** On Google, you can look for the ways of logging in to your router, it depends on the brand of the router.
          
          2. Select Network (on the top navigation bar).
          
          3. Go to Wireless 2.4 GHz and/or 5 GHz (on the left navigation), then you will see the option to change the channel. (For the 2.4 GHz band channels 1, 6, and 11 are recommended since they are the only non-overlapping channels). In my case, I have only "Wireless 2.4 GHz" option available, **so I just changed the channel to "11"**.
          
          4. Save this change and hopefully, your issue will also be solved.

12) After sleeping on the same issue last night I tried again this morning and resolved it in a couple of minutes (this is on Win 11 pc but should be fine on 10)   I created a hotspot to my phone
         **Searched for Realtek 8812AU Wireless driver** and found this link....https://driverpack.io/en/devices/wifi/realtek/realtek-8812au-wireless-lan-802-11ac-usb-nic?os=windows-10-x64
         
      **I downloaded the zip file. unzipped it**.
         
         **Went to device manager - clicked on Network Adaptors** Right clicked on Realtek 8812AU, Selected 'Browse my computer for drivers', selected the folder I had just unzipped to.
         
         After install my home network re-appeared and the problem was solved.
         
         Cheers all. 
         
         PS I had ordered this https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B01NBMJGA9/ref=ppx_od_dt_b_asin_title_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1 and might still keep it as I've just changed over service providers and the Eero router they provide should in theory be a lot faster with this card but we will see.


13) . I have an **Intel Dual Band Wireless-AC 7260 modem.**

I had to “Roll Back the Driver” then it could see and connect to my home network as it did before.. Crazy part is, the newest driver is from 2017 the rolled back one is 2015..

first of all go to Settings> Network and Internet**>WI-FI, click on Manage known networks on the side, select and then remove all network profiles present, then check if the network is detected and reconnect by re-entering the wi-fi password.**

Do you use the 2.4 or 5 GHz network? Does the problem occur for both networks? Do the 2 networks have the same SSID or different SSIDs?

Login to the router via another device, go to the wireless settings page and change the radio channel manually. **For the 2.4 GHz band choose channels 1, 6 or 11.** For the 5 GHz band, set channels 48, 64 or 136 .Save your changes, restart the router and try again.

14) Switched from the **Intel driver to the Microsoft driver and lo,** the digital divide parted and I now feast on delicious wifi. Thank you, kind internet stranger.
